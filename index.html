            <h2>About Jose Rizal</h2>
            <p>
                Jose Rizal, a Filipino nationalist and polymath, was born on June 19, 1861,
                 in Calamba, Laguna, Philippines, during the Spanish colonial period. 
                 He played a significant role in the Philippine Revolution against 
                 Spanish colonial rule through his works and activism. Here's some key 
                 information about him:</p>

            <div class="card-header">Nationalism</div>
            <div class="card-body"></div>
          <div class="card-text">José Rizal's nationalism was deeply    ingrained in his identity and permeated every aspect of his life. As a nationalist, Rizal held a strong sense of loyalty and devotion to the Philippines, striving for its independence and progress. <br>
<br>
            Rizal's nationalism was evident in his writings, where he passionately advocated for the rights and dignity of Filipinos under Spanish colonial rule. Through his novels, essays, and poetry, he exposed the injustices and abuses committed by the colonial regime, awakening national consciousness and fostering a sense of unity among his fellow Filipinos. <br>
<br>
            Furthermore, Rizal's nationalism was reflected in his actions and sacrifices for the cause of Philippine independence. Despite the personal risks and sacrifices involved, he dedicated his life to the struggle for freedom, demonstrating unwavering courage and determination in the face of adversity.

            <div class="card-header">Patriotism</div>
            <div class="card-body"></div>
                <div class="card-text">José Rizal's patriotism was deeply rooted in his profound love for the Philippines and his unwavering commitment to its liberation from colonial rule. He approached patriotism through various interconnected dimensions, demonstrating intellectual, cultural, and moral facets. <br>
<br>
                    Intellectually, Rizal believed in the transformative power of education and enlightenment as catalysts for national awakening and liberation. Through his writings, particularly his seminal novels "Noli Me Tangere" and "El Filibusterismo," he exposed the injustices of Spanish colonial rule, sparking a sense of national consciousness among his compatriots. <br>
<br>
                    Culturally, Rizal celebrated the richness of Filipino heritage, recognizing it as a vital aspect of national identity. He championed Filipino customs, traditions, and languages, viewing them as sources of strength and resilience in the face of oppression. His cultural pride fostered a sense of unity and solidarity among Filipinos, contributing to the collective spirit of resistance. <br>
<br>
                    In terms of resistance, Rizal advocated for non-violent means of struggle, emphasizing the importance of peaceful reform and dialogue. Despite witnessing the injustices perpetrated by the colonial regime, he remained steadfast in his commitment to effecting change through moral persuasion rather than violent confrontation. His advocacy for non-violence sought to unite rather than divide the Filipino people in their quest for freedom.

        <br>
        <h4>Parents & Siblings</h4>
        <p>The Rizals is considered one of the biggest families during their time. Domingo Lam-co, the family's paternal ascendant was a full-blooded Chinese who came to the Philippines from Amoy, China in the closing years of the 17th century and married a Chinese half-breed by the name of Ines de la Rosa.

        Researchers revealed that the Mercado-Rizal family had also traces of Japanese, Spanish, Malay and Even Negrito blood aside from Chinese.

        Jose Rizal came from a 13-member family consisting of his parents, Francisco Mercado II and Teodora Alonso Realonda, and nine sisters and one brother.</p>

            <br>
            <h5>First teacher</h5>
            <hr style="width:95%;">
            <p>Jose Rizal’s first teacher was his mother, who had taught him how to read and pray and who had encouraged him to write poetry. Later, private tutors taught the young Rizal Spanish and Latin, before he was sent to a private school in Biñan.
        
        <h5>Ateneo Municipal de Manila</h5>
            <hr style="width:95%;">
            When he was 11 years old, Rizal entered the Ateneo Municipal de Manila. He earned excellent marks in subjects like philosophy, physics, chemistry, and natural history. At this school, he read novels; wrote prize-winning poetry (and even a melodrama—“Junto al Pasig”); and practiced drawing, painting, and clay modeling, all of which remained lifelong interests for him.

        <h5>Univerity of Sto. Tomas </h5>
            <hr style="width:95%;">
            Rizal eventually earned a land surveyor’s and assessor’s degree from the Ateneo Municipal while taking up Philosophy and Letters at the University of Santo Tomas. Upon learning that his mother was going blind, Rizal opted to study ophthalmology at the UST Faculty of Medicine and Surgery. He, however, was not able to complete the course because “he became politically isolated by adversaries among the faculty and clergy who demanded that he assimilate to their system.”

        <h5>Universidad Central de Madrid</h5>
            <hr style="width:95%;">
            Without the knowledge of his parents, Rizal traveled to Europe in May 1882. According to his biographer, Austin Craig, Rizal, “in order to obtain a better education, had had to leave his country stealthily like a fugitive from justice, and his family, to save themselves from persecution, were compelled to profess ignorance of his plans and movements. His name was entered in Santo Tomas at the opening of the new term, with the fees paid, and Paciano had gone to Manila pretending to be looking for 
            Rizal earned a Licentiate in Medicine at the Universidad Central de Madrid, where he also took courses in philosophy and literature. It was in Madrid that he conceived of writing Noli Me Tangere. He also attended the University of Paris and, in 1887, completed his eye specialization course at the University of Heidelberg. It was also in that year that Rizal’s first novel was published (in Berlin). <br>
            <br>
            Rizal is said to have had the ability to master various skills, subjects, and languages. Our national hero was also a doctor, farmer, naturalist (he discovered the Draco rizali, a small lizard; Apogania rizali, a beetle; and the Rhacophorus rizali, a frog), writer, visual artist, athlete (martial arts, fencing, and pistol shooting), musician, and social scientist.</p>

            <h2>Works</h2>
            <p>
                Rizal's works include novels such as Noli Me Tangere and El Filibusterismo, which are considered some of the most important works in Filipino literature.

                <h2>Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not)</h2>
                <p>Noli Me Tangere (Touch Me Not):
                        Published in 1887, "Noli Me Tangere" is Rizal's first novel and is
                         considered one of the most influential works of Philippine literature.
                          It exposed the injustices and abuses of Spanish colonial rule in the
                           Philippines, particularly the oppressive social system and religious 
                           hypocrisy. The novel follows the story of Juan Crisostomo Ibarra,
                            a young Filipino who returns to the Philippines from Europe, only
                             to witness the corruption and oppression prevalent in his homeland.</p>

            <div class="card">
                <h2>El Filibusterismo (The Filibuster)</h2>
                <p>Published in 1891 as a sequel to "Noli Me Tangere," "El Filibusterismo" delves deeper into the themes
                     of social injustice and oppression. The novel explores the consequences of colonial abuses and the failure 
                    of peaceful reform efforts, ultimately leading to a tragic and violent conclusion. Like its predecessor,
                     "El Filibusterismo" is a scathing critique of Spanish colonial rule and its impact on Filipino society.</p>
